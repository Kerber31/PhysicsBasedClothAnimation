# Physics-Based Cloth Animation

This project consists in a 3D simulation of cloth physics using Verlet Integration. It was developed as the final assignment for the Numerical Analysis class at PUC-Rio. The project consists of two parts: the physics simulation algorithm written in C++, and the visualization created with OpenGL 4+ using Qt Creator. For more details about the methodology and implementation, [please check out the final report](https://github.com/pedromsferraz/PhysicsBasedClothAnimation/blob/main/Physics-Based%20Cloth%20Animation.pdf).
 
 ## Features:
 * Create animations for any rectangular cloth.
 * Blinn-Phong Lighting Model, with diffuse, specular and ambient lighting.
 * Zoom and Arcball for adjusting the camera.

## Animations
The following animations were created applying a sum of forces of gravity and dynamic wind to the cloth.
